# Some stuff to gotta know before coding
- You can't use Codename's default input check system on DeltaFlixel, this is because DeltaFlixel has it's own input check system called ``keys``. (due to android support)

All the input checks will be here below:
```
keys.UP
keys.DOWN
keys.LEFT
keys.RIGHT
keys.UP_P
keys.DOWN_P
keys.LEFT_P
keys.RIGHT_P
keys.ACCEPT
keys.ACCEPT_HOLD
keys.BACK
keys.BACK_HOLD
keys.MENU
keys.MENU_HOLD
```
